<!-- Multiverse-Portals bug reporting guide

Don't put anything inside this block, as it won't be included in the issue.

Get latest build from: http://ci.onarandombox.com/view/Multiverse/

If you are having issues with other submodules of Multiverse, go to their respective git repo:
    Multiverse-Core: https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues
    Multiverse-NetherPortals: https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-NetherPortals/issues
    Multiverse-Inventories: https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Inventories/issues

If you are reporting a bug, please follow the following steps:

1.  Fill out the template in full.
      Run the commands in the console. Don't just put "latest" as a version,
      or we will ignore it.

2.  When linking files, do not attach them to the post!
      Copy and paste any logs into https://gist.github.com/, then paste a
      link to them in the relevant parts of the template.
      **DO NOT drag files into this box!**

3.  Make sure not to write between the arrows, as anything there will be
    hidden.

4.  Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue!       -->
